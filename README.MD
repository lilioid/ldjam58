In **Type II**, you control a Space Faring Civilization on it's quest to become a Type II Civilization on the Kardashev Scale and harness the full energy output of its star.

Launch Energy Collectors into space and manage their orbits to maximize energy collection while avoiding collisions.

## Controls
- Aim, hold and release with your **Left Mouse Button** to launch energy collectors.
- Press **Space** to use fuel and slow down the collector to adjust the orbit.
- You can speed up and slow down time with the arrow keys.
- Hover over collectors to select them for adjustment and view their orbit.

You have 10 minutes to construct your energy collection network. Good luck!
